This project aims to find out the leading risk factors for cardiovasular diseases for males.

We cleaned our data by removing females, limited the height and weight to be 165cm - 175cm and 60Kg - 90Kg
The age was in days so we converted it to years

We also made use of visualisation tools such as a histogram, countplot and boxplot

For Machine learning, we learnt 3 new techniques: Gradient Boosting Classifier, Logistic Regression and SGD Classifier.

We found out that Gradient Boosting Classifier gave us the highest accuracy of 0.6398.

Thus, we will proceed with using Gradient Boosting Classifier to train the machine and provide us with predictions on whether or not a male is at high risk of cardiovascular diseases with an accuracy of 64.0%

With the data provided, we have analysed 4 variables which may affect the risks of a male getting cardiovascular diseases, namely smoking, drinking alcohol, active level, and cholesterol level.

We have concluded that cholesterol affects the risks of cardiovascular diseases the most.
